# About the mod
This mod was my first mod and I think that as I learn more, the features will become better and more. I plan on using the batteries for machines and to make this mod more tech based.
> Please don't comment on the horrendous textures of this mod. I did them and I suck at drawing.
> When I will add entities and block entities, the models will be so much worse than the textures beacause I am not an graphic or 3D designer.
